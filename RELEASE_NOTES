Minimum Profit Release Notes
============================

5.42
----

 - New features:
    - Speed improvements in ANSI and ncurses drivers. This will be
      specially noticed in slow systems like the oldest Raspberry Pies.
    - In build (makefile) and grep logs, the ENTER key activates
      the 'open_under_cursor' action.
 - Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rounding error in emacs-style scrolling.

5.41
----

 - Bug fixes:
    - Fixed crash in Qt5 startup.
    - Fixed typo in Perl syntax highlight.

5.40
----

 - Updated maintainers.

5.39
----

 - New features:
    - The usage of Unicode characters in text menus, games, etc.
      can be disabled by setting the configuration variable
      `mp.config.use_unicode' to 0.
 - Other changes:
    - Some internal optimizations to visual wrapping code.

5.38
----

 - New features:
    - A new visual wrap mode, where lines longer than the
      application window wrap (with special marking) instead
      of disappearing to the right. It's implemented in the
      `toggle_visual_wrap' action (bound by default to
      `ctrl-k') and can be activated from the configuration
      file by setting `mp.config.visual_wrap' to 1.
 - Other changes:
    - When hard word wrapping is not set, the `word_wrap_paragraph' 
      action behaves like `join_paragraph' (i.e. word-wraps to
      an infinite column).

5.37
----

 - Bug fixes:
    - Fixed compilation issues under FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
 - New features:
    - New game 'Puzzle'.

5.36
----

 - Bug fixes:

    - Fixed not-that-read-only read-only documents.
    - Fixed crash in GTK clipboard.
    - The Qt driver now shows less 'shaky' text.
 - Other changes:
    - The Unicode character to show tabs is now U+2192.
    - The mptxt export functions now manage 'strong' and 'em'
      spreading multiple lines.

5.35
----

This release includes a big set of new features and bugfixes by
fellow developer X-Ryl669.

 - Important changes:
    - Some default keycodes have been changed:
      - `ctrl-space' now triggers `complete' instead of the menu.
      - `shift-f10' now opens the menu in text interfaces.
      - `ctrl-u' now calls `complete_with_clang' instead of
        previous `complete'.
 - New features:
    - History (search, replace, etc.) is saved.
    - Interactive search when entering filenames in text
      interfaces (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Reduce the number of undo while typing (once every second
      at maximum) (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Allow hint to also select directories in file selector
      (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Add support for mouse wheel scroll down event on ncurses
      (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Add support for showing list wherever we want in text
      interfaces (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Make tag completion inline with context instead of on a
      new window in text interfaces (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Add support for multiline editing: When you have selected
      multiple lines in a rectangular block, and started inserting
      text, it'll be reproduced on all lines (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Added clang completion for C/C++ languages (work by X-Ryl669).
    - HTML export now includes a page break in CSS.
    - Added footer page number in troff exporting.
    - Added footer page number in RTF exporting.
    - New command line argument -F, to execute an MPSL script
      and exit immediately after.
    - Tabs are always shown differently from spaces.
 - Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a serious bug in GTK redraws.
    - Fixed crashes in Qt5.
    - Fixed directory walk up in text interfaces file browser
      (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Fixed block marking options from the main menu.
    - Fixed insert_time_stamp action.
    - Fixed some bugs in completion.
    - Fixed a bug when drawing double-width characters (they
      were sometimes printed twice).
    - Fix a of-by-one error in the vertical selection code
      while deleting (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Fix a of-by-one error in indenting a block of many
      selected lines where the last line was never indented
      (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Fix a bug that's crashing mp when loading a session
      (work by X-Ryl669).
    - Fixed Qt building.

5.34
----

 - New features:
    - New syntax highlight definitions for RTF files.
 - Bug fixes:
    - The GTK clipboard code has been rewritten to support
      copy / paste of characters with high Unicode points.
    - Fixed some memory leaks in underlying libraries.

5.33
----

 - New features:
    - Double page mode: if the viewport screen is wider than
      the value in mp.config.double_page (default: 120), two
      pages are shown simultaneously. If you don't like this
      mode, set mp.config.double_page to 0 in the configuration
      file.
    - New command line option -ni for "non-interactive" mode.
      Expected to be used with -e or -f. No video driver is
      tried and it exists immediately after executing the
      code or script.
    - Native encoding support for Windows-1252 code page.
 - Other stuff:
    - A new script ms-windows-build.sh, to build 32 and 64
      bit MS Windows binaries using mingw32.

5.32
----

 - New features:
    - There is a new version format (2) for encrypted files.
      The cypher algorithm is the same, but includes a CRC, so
      that it's possible to know if the content has been
      correctly decrypted (i.e. the decryption password is
      valid). New encrypted documents use version 2, but
      version 1 documents are not automatically upgraded.
      If you want to do it, open a version 1 document, hit ESC,
      type `mp.active.crypt_ver = 2' and save it back.
      *NOTE*: This encryption format, though it uses a known
      algorithm, has not been audited by anyone remotely
      versed in cryptography, so you are at your own risk.
    - The ANSI driver now support 256 color; if the config
      variable mp.config.ansi_color256 is set to non-zero,
      the 'gui' color definitions shall be used instead of
      the usual 'text' definitions.
    - In Linux and similar systems, both a .desktop and icon
      files are installed.
    - In the 'build target' list, also add the generic syntax-
      dependent build targets at the end (i.e. when editing a
      Python file in a Makefile-controlled folder, the execute
      and syntax check options are shown at the end).
    - New mptxt exporting to .troff format.
    - New mptxt exporting to .html format.
  - Other changes:
    - The `export_as_rtf' action no longer exists; it has been
      replaced by 'export'.
    - There has been many internal changes due to both MPDM
      and MPSL being moving targets, now that they are heavily
      refactored. None of these changes add anything new nor
      fix previous bugs.
    - Fixed some whining about deprecated usage in GTK driver.
    - In the easter egg / hidden game 'maze', pressing f1
      shows a compass hint instead of the hero.

5.31
----

 - License change: released into the public domain.
 - Improvements:
    - The RTF export function has been rewritten. The generated
      markup is much better and shows OK in most of the
      inconsistent, crappy world of the RTF reader
      implementations.  Also, there are several configurable
      options (see the `doc/mp_configuration.txt' document).
 - Bug fixes:
    - Many that I don't remember. Mostly they were new
      bugs introduced by changes in MPDM and MPSL.
    - Fixed Curses driver, broken some versions ago.
 - New features:
    - There is native encoding support for MSDOS 437 and 850
      page codes.
    - New Pascal syntax highlight (yes, Pascal, no kidding).
      I've been digging in very old shit.
    - The ANSI driver now accepts alt-letter keycodes.
    - The execute MPSL code function always dumps its output
      to the dump window.

5.3.0
-----

 - Architectural changes:
   - Major refactoring; old code pruned and cleaned, memory
     management improved.
   - MPSL code is no longer deployed as separate files, but
     embedded in a tar file or inside the program binary itself.
   - Some MPSL code is loaded on demand.
   - New "portable" (i.e. no installation needed) versions for
     MS Windows.
 - New features:
   - New action `insert_m_dash', bound by default to `alt-minus'.
   - New action `replace_tabs_with_spaces'.
   - New action `replace_spaces_with_tabs'.
   - New action `open_recent', to pick the file to open from
     the previosly opened ones.
 - Other changes:
   - Versioning have changed from x.x.x to x.yyy.
   - The coloring theme for GUI drivers has changed to something
     with dark background and softer colors. If you want to revert
     the classic, bright colors on white background theme, copy
     and paste the following into the configuration file:

    /* Minimum Profit Classic */
    mp.colors.normal.gui        = [ 0x000000, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.cursor.gui        = mp.colors.normal.gui;
    mp.colors.selection.gui     = [ 0xff0000, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.comments.gui      = [ 0x00cc77, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.documentation.gui = [ 0x8888ff, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.quotes.gui        = [ 0x0000ff, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.matching.gui      = [ 0x000000, 0xffff00 ];
    mp.colors.word1.gui         = [ 0x00aa00, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.word2.gui         = [ 0xff6666, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.word3.gui         = [ 0x000088, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.tag.gui           = [ 0x8888ff, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.spell.gui         = [ 0xff8888, 0xffffff ];
    mp.colors.search.gui        = [ 0x000000, 0x00cc77 ];
